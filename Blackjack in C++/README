/* STILL IN PROGRESS */

Constructed new Blackjack Card Game in C++ using layout of old Blackjack Card Game in C located in other directory of this repo.
This implementation included classes, i.e., use of function overloading, methods, etc.
Two version of main have been added. main.cpp is fully functional but is played solely through the terminal.
gui_main.cpp has am included a minimalistic gui for commands in the game displayed through a window with win32 api. Only includes stand, hit, double, and change bet 
buttons but all inputs and instructions are still currently located in the terminal. The final goal will be to implement windows which display each of the players and dealers 
cards alongside their respective counters for hand value.
Fixed minor bugs with double feature that were present in old Blackjack Card game in C.
